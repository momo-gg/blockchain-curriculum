## Core Blockchain Concepts

### Account
An addressable storage unit on Solana that can hold data and SOL. Every piece of state on Solana lives in an account. Accounts have an owner (a program that controls them), a balance (lamports), and optional data.

### Address
A 32-byte public key encoded in Base58. Used to identify accounts, programs, and wallets on the network. Example: `11111111111111111111111111111111`

### Block
A collection of transactions processed together and added to the blockchain. On Solana, block timing is derived from slot timing and can vary (as of `solana-labs/solana` clock constants).

### Blockchain
A distributed, immutable ledger of transactions maintained by a network of nodes through consensus. Each block references the previous block, creating a chain.

### Commitment
The level of finality for a transaction or account query. Levels (from least to most final):
- **processed**: Seen by the connected node
- **confirmed**: Voted on by supermajority of stake
- **finalized**: Cannot be rolled back (see Solana commitment docs)

### Consensus
The mechanism by which network participants agree on the state of the blockchain. Solana uses a combination of Proof of Stake and Proof of History.

### Decentralization
Distribution of control across multiple parties without a central authority. Measured by number of validators, stake distribution, and geographic spread.

### Fork
When the blockchain diverges into two or more potential paths. Solana's consensus resolves forks to maintain a single canonical chain.

### Finality
The guarantee that a transaction cannot be reversed. On Solana, finality is expressed via commitment levels (as of [docs.solanalabs.com/consensus/commitments](https://docs.solanalabs.com/consensus/commitments)).

### Hash
A fixed-size output from a cryptographic function. Used for block identification, transaction signatures, and data integrity verification.

### Immutability
The property that once data is written to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted.

### Lamport
The smallest unit of SOL. 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 (10^9) lamports. Named after computer scientist Leslie Lamport.

### Ledger
The complete history of all transactions on the blockchain, maintained by validators.

### Node
A computer running Solana software that participates in the network. Can be a validator (producing blocks) or RPC node (serving queries).

### Slot
A time window (target ~400ms) during which a leader can produce a block. The fundamental time unit in Solana (as of `solana-labs/solana` clock constants).

### Transaction
A signed message instructing the network to execute one or more operations. Contains instructions, signatures, and account references.

## Solana-Specific Terms

### Anchor
The dominant framework for Solana program development. Provides Rust macros and conventions that reduce boilerplate and improve security.

### BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)
The bytecode format Solana programs compile to. Programs are deployed as BPF binaries executed by the Solana runtime.

### Cluster
A set of validators working together to maintain the ledger. Main clusters:
- **mainnet-beta**: Production network
- **devnet**: Development and testing
- **testnet**: Validator testing

### Compute Units (CU)
A measure of computational resources consumed by a transaction. Limits vary by cluster and release (as of `solana-labs/solana`).

### Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)
When one program calls another program within a transaction. Enables composability between programs.

### Epoch
A period during which the leader schedule remains fixed. Length is defined by protocol constants and can change by configuration (as of `solana-labs/solana` clock constants).

### Geyser
A plugin system for validators that streams account and transaction data in real-time. Used for building indexers and analytics.

### IDL (Interface Definition Language)
A JSON file describing a program's instructions, accounts, and types. Generated by Anchor and used by clients for type-safe interactions.

### Leader
The validator responsible for producing blocks during a specific slot. Selected based on stake weight.

### Leader Schedule
A predetermined order of which validators will be leaders for upcoming slots. Generated for each epoch based on stake distribution.

### Priority Fee
An optional additional fee paid to incentivize validators to include a transaction, especially during congestion. Measured in micro-lamports per compute unit.

### Proof of History (PoH)
Solana's innovation for proving time passage without coordination. A verifiable delay function that creates a historical record.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
Consensus mechanism where validators stake SOL to participate in block production. More stake = higher probability of being selected as leader.

### Program
Executable code deployed on Solana (analogous to "smart contract" on other chains). Programs are stateless and process instructions.

### Program Derived Address (PDA)
A special type of address derived from a program ID and seeds that doesn't have a corresponding private key. Used for program-controlled accounts.

### Rent
The SOL cost for storing data on-chain. Accounts must maintain a minimum rent-exempt balance (as of [solana.com/docs](https://solana.com/docs)).

### Rent Exemption
When an account holds enough SOL to cover rent indefinitely (minimum balance varies by data size, refunded on close).

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
The API interface for interacting with Solana nodes. Used to query state, submit transactions, and subscribe to updates.

### Sealevel
Solana's parallel smart contract runtime that enables concurrent transaction processing on multiple cores.

### Slot
The period (target ~400ms) in which a validator can produce a block. Multiple slots may pass between blocks (as of `solana-labs/solana` clock constants).

### SOL
The native cryptocurrency of Solana, used for transaction fees, rent, and staking.

### Stake
SOL delegated to a validator to participate in consensus. Stakers earn rewards proportional to their stake.

### System Program
The native Solana program that handles basic operations: creating accounts, transferring SOL, allocating space.

### Token Program
The SPL program that implements fungible token functionality: minting, transferring, burning tokens.

### Tower BFT
Solana's consensus algorithm, a PoH-optimized version of PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance).

### Turbine
Solana's block propagation protocol that breaks blocks into smaller packets for efficient distribution across the network.

### Validator
A node that participates in consensus by voting on blocks and (if selected as leader) producing new blocks.

### Vote Account
An account associated with a validator that tracks their voting history and stake.

## Development Terms

### ATA (Associated Token Account)
A deterministically derived token account address for a specific wallet and mint combination. Ensures one canonical token account per wallet per token.

### Bump Seed
An additional byte added to PDA derivation seeds to ensure the resulting address is off the Ed25519 curve (no private key exists).

### Deserialize

### Discriminator
An 8-byte identifier at the start of Anchor account data that uniquely identifies the account type.

### Idempotent

### Instruction
A single operation within a transaction. Contains a program ID, account list, and instruction data.

### Keypair
A public key and corresponding private key used for signing transactions.

### Mint
