# 3.5 Staking Mechanics

> *"Staking is how you participate in securing the network and earn rewards for doing so."*

---

## Why This Matters

Staking isn't just "locking up tokens for yield." It's the mechanism that:
- Secures the network (stake = weight in consensus)
- Distributes inflation rewards
- Aligns incentives between token holders and validators
- Creates economic consequences for misbehavior

Understanding staking helps you make informed decisions about where to stake, what risks you're taking, and how rewards actually work.

---

## 🟢 General Understanding

### What Is Staking?

Staking means delegating your SOL to a validator to increase their voting power:

```
Your SOL (unstaked)
    │
    ▼ (You delegate to Validator A)
Validator A's total stake increases
    │
    ▼ (Validator A votes with more weight)
Network is more secure
    │
    ▼ (Validator A earns rewards proportional to stake)
You receive your share of rewards
```

**You're not giving away your SOL:**
- You retain ownership
- You can unstake anytime (after cooldown)
- Validator cannot access your funds
- Only the inflation rewards are shared

### How Rewards Work

Solana has built-in inflation that rewards stakers:

**Current Inflation Schedule**

```
Year 1 (2020): 8% inflation
Year 2: ~7.5%
Year 3: ~7%
...
Long-term target: 1.5%

Decreases 15% annually until reaching 1.5%
Current (2024): ~5.5%
```

**Where Rewards Come From**

```
New SOL Minted:
  - ~5.5% of total supply per year
  - Distributed to stakers proportionally
  - Not from "thin air" — it's protocol design

Distribution:
  - 100% goes to staked validators
  - Validators share with delegators (minus commission)
```

**Your APY Calculation**

```
Network staking rate: 70% of SOL staked
Network inflation: 5.5%

Your nominal APY = inflation / staking_rate
                 = 5.5% / 0.70
                 = ~7.8%

Minus validator commission (e.g., 5%):
  Effective APY = 7.8% × 0.95 = ~7.4%

If only 50% were staked:
  Your APY = 5.5% / 0.50 = 11% (higher!)
```

> 💡 **Key Insight**: The less SOL is staked, the higher the APY for those who do stake. This incentivizes more staking until an equilibrium.

### When Are Rewards Distributed?

**Per Epoch (~2-3 days)**

```
Epoch 432 ends
    ↓
Reward calculation runs
    ↓
Credits counted for each validator
    ↓
Rewards deposited to stake accounts
    ↓
Epoch 433 begins

Your stake account balance increases automatically.
```

**Not Compounding by Default**

Your rewards go to your stake account, but:
- They're not automatically re-staked
- They earn rewards in the current epoch
- But they increase your stake for future epochs

### How Do I Choose Where to Stake?

**Key Metrics to Consider**

| Metric | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| Commission | Lower = more rewards for you (0-10% typical) |
| APY | Higher isn't always better (check why) |
| Skip rate | Lower is better (<5% ideal) |
| Stake concentration | Avoid top validators (decentralization) |
| Uptime | Higher is better (>99%) |
| Version | Current version = up to date |

**Does It Matter Where I Stake?**

Yes:
- Higher commission = lower rewards for you
- Bad validator = lower rewards (skip rate)
- Concentrated validators = bad for network
- Slashing risk (currently minimal on Solana)

**Recommended Approach**

```
1. Avoid top 10 validators by stake (decentralization)
2. Check commission (5-10% is reasonable)
3. Verify performance (>98% uptime, <5% skip rate)
4. Consider geography (different regions = resilience)
5. Evaluate validator's reputation and track record
```

## 🟡 PM/EM Depth

### Does Bitcoin Have Staking?

**Bitcoin = Proof of Work = No Native Staking**

```
Bitcoin:
  - Miners compete with hardware
  - No concept of "staking" at protocol level
  - Energy expenditure = security

Solana:
  - Validators stake SOL
  - Stake weight = voting power
  - Economic stake = security
```

**"Staking" in Bitcoin Ecosystem**

There are derivative products:
- Wrapped BTC on other chains (wBTC staking)
- Bitcoin DeFi protocols (Stacks, RSK)
- Centralized "earn" products (Celsius-style, risky)

But these aren't native Bitcoin staking — they're third-party products with counterparty risk.

### What Happens If My Validator Gets Slashed?

**Current State: Minimal Slashing on Solana**

Unlike Ethereum, Solana's slashing is mostly theoretical:

```
Ethereum Slashing:
  - Immediate financial penalty
  - Up to entire stake can be lost
  - Forced exit from validator set

Solana Slashing:
  - Not currently activated for most offenses
  - Focus on reward reduction, not stake seizure
  - "Slashing" mostly means: lost rewards, not lost stake
```

**What Validators Can Be Punished For**

| Offense | Current Consequence |
|---------|---------------------|
| Double voting | Potential future slashing |
| Going offline | Lost rewards for those epochs |
| Poor performance | Stakers leave (market punishment) |
| Malicious behavior | Social slashing (community excludes) |

**Delegator Risk**

Currently very low:
- If validator performs poorly → lower rewards
- If validator goes offline → no rewards during downtime
- Your principal is safe

Future (if slashing activates):
- Potential for stake loss
- Important to diversify across validators

### Are Staked Tokens Visible On-Chain?

**Yes, completely transparent:**

```
Your wallet: 7xKX...abc123
  └── Token Account: 100 USDC
  └── Stake Account: 1000 SOL delegated to Validator A
  └── Stake Account: 500 SOL delegated to Validator B

All visible on any block explorer.
```

**Do They Count in Your Wallet Balance?**

Depends on the wallet:
- Most wallets show staked SOL separately
- Some combine into total balance
- Staked SOL can't be spent without unstaking first

### What Does "50% of Fees Are Burned" Mean?

**Fee Distribution**

```
User pays: 0.000005 SOL transaction fee

Distribution:
  - 50% burned: 0.0000025 SOL destroyed forever
  - 50% to leader: 0.0000025 SOL to block producer

"Burned" means:
  - Removed from circulation
  - Reduces total supply
  - Deflationary pressure
```

**Why Burn?**

```
Without burn:
  Inflation adds supply → dilutes value
  Fees add more supply (to validators) → more dilution

With burn:
  Inflation adds supply → dilutes value
  Fees partially offset inflation → less dilution

If fees burned > inflation:
  Net deflationary (hasn't happened yet)
```

**Who "Suffers"?**

```
Direct impact: Validators get less (only 50% of fees)
Indirect benefit: Token holders (less dilution)

The burn benefits all SOL holders by reducing supply.
Validators benefit from price appreciation if burn helps price.
```

### Liquid Staking: mSOL, jitoSOL, bSOL

**The Problem with Regular Staking**

```
You stake 100 SOL
  → 100 SOL locked for 2-3 days to unstake
  → Can't use in DeFi
  → Opportunity cost
```

**Liquid Staking Solution**

```
You deposit 100 SOL into liquid staking protocol
  → Receive 100 mSOL (Marinade) or jitoSOL (Jito) or bSOL (Blaze)
  → Protocol stakes your SOL across many validators
  → You use mSOL in DeFi (swap, lend, LP)
  → mSOL value increases over time (accrues rewards)
```

**How Value Accrues**

```
Day 1:
  - Deposit: 100 SOL
  - Receive: 100 mSOL
  - mSOL/SOL rate: 1.0

Day 365:
  - Your 100 mSOL is now worth ~107 SOL
  - mSOL/SOL rate: ~1.07
  - You didn't do anything — rewards auto-compound

To exit:
  - Swap mSOL → SOL on DEX (instant, small fee)
  - Or unstake through protocol (wait period, no fee)
```

**Comparison**

| Token | Protocol | Validator Strategy | MEV |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| mSOL | Marinade | Score-based selection | No |
| jitoSOL | Jito | Jito validators | Yes |
| bSOL | Blaze | Community validators | No |
| jupSOL | Jupiter | Jupiter validators | Partial |

### Stake Concentration Concerns

**The Problem**

```
If top 10 validators control 50% of stake:
  - They could collude
  - Network depends on them
  - Centralization risk

Solana's Nakamoto coefficient: ~19
  - Need 19 validators to reach 33%
  - Better than some, worse than others
```

**Why Concentration Happens**

```
Stakers choose:
  - Big exchanges (easy, trusted brand)
  - Top APY (often unsustainably subsidized)
  - Default options in wallets

Result:
  - Rich get richer
  - Small validators struggle
  - Network becomes less decentralized
```

**What You Can Do**

```
Stake with:
  - Validators outside top 33
  - Different geographic regions
  - Different entity types (not all exchanges)

Use liquid staking that spreads stake:
  - Marinade distributes to 100+ validators
  - Better for decentralization
```

### Stake Account Structure

```rust
pub struct StakeState {
    pub meta: Meta,
    pub stake: Option<Stake>,
}

pub struct Meta {
    pub rent_exempt_reserve: u64,    // Minimum balance
    pub authorized: Authorized,       // Who can stake/withdraw
    pub lockup: Lockup,               // Optional time lock
}

pub struct Stake {
    pub delegation: Delegation,
    pub credits_observed: u64,        // For reward calculation
}

pub struct Delegation {
    pub voter_pubkey: Pubkey,         // Which validator
    pub stake: u64,                   // Amount delegated
    pub activation_epoch: Epoch,      // When delegation started
    pub deactivation_epoch: Epoch,    // When unstaking started
    pub warmup_cooldown_rate: f64,    // 0.25 by default
}
```

### Stake Account Lifecycle

```
1. CREATE (System Program)
   create_account() → empty account

2. INITIALIZE (Stake Program)
   initialize() → set authorities, lockup

3. DELEGATE (Stake Program)
   delegate() → specify validator vote account
   - Stake is "activating"
   - Takes 1 epoch to become active

4. ACTIVE
   - Earning rewards each epoch
   - Counted in validator's voting weight

5. DEACTIVATE (Stake Program)
   deactivate() → start cooldown
   - Takes 1 epoch to fully deactivate
   - Still earns partial rewards during cooldown

6. WITHDRAW (Stake Program)
   withdraw() → remove SOL after deactivation
   - Only after deactivation_epoch + 1
```

### Reward Calculation

```rust
// Simplified reward calculation
fn calculate_stake_rewards(
    stake: &Stake,
    vote_state: &VoteState,
    point_value: f64,
) -> u64 {
    // Credits earned by validator this epoch
    let credits_earned = vote_state.epoch_credits.last()
        - stake.credits_observed;

    // Points = stake × credits
    let points = stake.delegation.stake * credits_earned;

    // Rewards = points × point_value
    let rewards = (points as f64 * point_value) as u64;

    // Apply validator commission
    let commission = vote_state.commission as f64 / 100.0;
    let delegator_rewards = rewards * (1.0 - commission);

    delegator_rewards
}
```

**Point Value Calculation**

```rust
// Total points in epoch
let total_points: u128 = all_stakes.iter()
    .map(|s| s.stake * s.credits_earned)
    .sum();

// Total rewards available
let total_rewards = inflation_for_epoch();

// Value per point
let point_value = total_rewards as f64 / total_points as f64;
```

### Stake Warmup and Cooldown

```rust
const WARMUP_COOLDOWN_RATE: f64 = 0.25;

fn effective_stake(
    stake: u64,
    current_epoch: Epoch,
    activation_epoch: Epoch,
    deactivation_epoch: Epoch,
) -> u64 {
    if current_epoch < activation_epoch {
        // Not yet activating
        return 0;
    }

    if deactivation_epoch != Epoch::MAX {
        // Deactivating
        let epochs_since_deactivation = current_epoch - deactivation_epoch;
        let remaining = (1.0 - WARMUP_COOLDOWN_RATE).powi(epochs_since_deactivation);
        return (stake as f64 * remaining) as u64;
    }

    // Activating or fully active
    let epochs_since_activation = current_epoch - activation_epoch;
    let progress = 1.0 - (1.0 - WARMUP_COOLDOWN_RATE).powi(epochs_since_activation);
    (stake as f64 * progress.min(1.0)) as u64
}
```

### Split and Merge Operations

**Splitting a Stake Account**

```rust
pub fn split(
    stake_account: &Pubkey,
    authorized: &Keypair,
    lamports: u64,
    split_stake: &Keypair,
) -> Instruction {
    stake_instruction::split(
        stake_account,
        &authorized.pubkey(),
        lamports,
        &split_stake.pubkey(),
    )
}

// Use case: Move some stake to different validator
// Original: 1000 SOL delegated to Validator A
// After split:
//   - Original: 600 SOL → Validator A
//   - Split: 400 SOL → Redelegate to Validator B
```

**Merging Stake Accounts**

```rust
pub fn merge(
    destination: &Pubkey,
    source: &Pubkey,
    authorized: &Keypair,
) -> Instruction {
    stake_instruction::merge(
        destination,
        source,
        &authorized.pubkey(),
    )
}

// Requirements:
// - Same authorized staker
// - Same lockup
// - Both active or both inactive
// - Same validator if active
```

### Epoch Boundary Processing

```
Epoch N ends
    │
    ▼
REWARD DISTRIBUTION (compute-intensive)
    │
    ├── Calculate total credits per validator
    ├── Calculate point value
    ├── For each stake account:
    │     └── Calculate and credit rewards
    ├── Credit validator commissions
    └── Update stake account credits_observed
    │
    ▼
LEADER SCHEDULE GENERATION
    │
    ├── Snapshot effective stake
    ├── Generate random schedule
    └── Publish for next epoch
    │
    ▼
Epoch N+1 begins
```

**SIMD-0096: Partitioned Epoch Rewards**

```
Problem:
  - Epoch boundary processes millions of stake accounts
  - Causes block production delays
  - Validators need huge memory

Solution:
  - Spread reward distribution across multiple blocks
  - Reduces peak memory usage
  - Smoother epoch transitions
```

### Liquid Staking: Technical Implementation

**Marinade (mSOL) Architecture**

```
User deposits SOL

    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Marinade State Account              │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────   │
│  total_deposited: 10,000,000 SOL            │
│  total_mSOL: 9,345,794 mSOL                 │
│  msol_price: 10M / 9.3M = 1.07 SOL/mSOL    │
│                                              │
│  Validator Stake Distribution:               │
│    Validator A: 500,000 SOL (5%)            │
│    Validator B: 300,000 SOL (3%)            │
│    ...                                       │
│    100+ validators                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
User receives mSOL (value increases over time)
```

**Price Update Mechanism**

```rust
// Each epoch, after rewards:
fn update_msol_price(state: &mut MarinadeState) {
    // Total value = all staked SOL + rewards
    let total_sol = state.stake_accounts.iter()
        .map(|s| s.balance)
        .sum::<u64>();

    // mSOL supply is fixed (only changes on deposits/withdrawals)
    let msol_supply = state.total_msol;

    // New price
    state.msol_price = total_sol as f64 / msol_supply as f64;
}

// Example:
// Start: 1,000,000 SOL backing 1,000,000 mSOL = 1.0
// After rewards: 1,070,000 SOL backing 1,000,000 mSOL = 1.07
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Staking = delegating to validators** — you keep ownership
2. **Rewards come from inflation** — currently ~5.5% annually
3. **APY depends on staking rate** — fewer stakers = higher APY
4. **Validator choice matters** — commission, performance, decentralization
5. **Slashing is minimal (for now)** — delegator risk is mainly opportunity cost
6. **Liquid staking unlocks capital** — use staked SOL in DeFi
7. **Stake concentration is a concern** — stake outside top validators
