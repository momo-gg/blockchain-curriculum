## Priority Gaps to Address

### High Priority (Core Understanding)
1. ⚠️ PoW vs PoS comparison needs dedicated section
2. ⚠️ "Where does the protocol live?" needs answer
3. ⚠️ Blockchain clients explanation needed
4. ⚠️ Finality vs throughput (Visa question)

### Medium Priority (Solana Specifics)
1. Staking mechanics module
2. MEV module
3. Validator economics detail
4. Multiple client ecosystem

### Lower Priority (Advanced)
1. Cryptographic deep dives (Ed25519 math)
2. MPC/secret sharing
3. Seedless wallet architecture
