title: "Blockchain & Solana from First Principles"
description: "Learn about Blockchain & Solana from First Principles in the Solana onboarding curriculum."
---

> An internal learning guide for understanding blockchain technology and Solana, designed for product managers, engineering managers, and engineers.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This curriculum answers **"Why?"** before **"How?"** — building understanding progressively from the problems that led to Bitcoin, through Ethereum's innovations, to Solana's unique approach.
