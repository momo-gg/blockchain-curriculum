> **A comprehensive learning guide for understanding blockchain technology and Solana — from first principles to production deployment.**

---

## Overview

This curriculum answers **"Why?"** before **"How?"** — building understanding progressively from the problems that led to Bitcoin, through Ethereum's innovations, to Solana's unique architecture and development ecosystem.

### What Makes This Different

| Traditional Tutorials       | This Curriculum                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Jump straight to code       | Build conceptual foundation first                |
| Assume blockchain knowledge | Start from trust problem                         |
| Single audience             | Three audience tracks (General, PM/EM, Engineer) |
| Scattered resources         | Progressive, interconnected modules              |
| Focus on syntax             | Focus on mental models                           |
